### Notes:
- I referenced the image badge with the relative path `./5b43ed32-0db4-4339-b946-3151d4ead9a6.png`. Make sure this image is included in your repo’s root folder or adjust the path accordingly.
- If you want, I can also create or help design proper screenshots, badges (e.g., GitHub Actions), or a demo GIF for your app.

Would you like me to help you auto-generate one of those visuals next?
